This project is ready to install version, 
to facilitate the installation process, 
you can use the default naming used in config file as yours,
'dbname' => 'cloudvir_cv',
'dbuser' => 'cloudvir_cv',
as it is obvious in above, you need to create a database and user by the name of 'cloudvir_cv'.

it is crucial to use the Forced language and locale Options in config.php as 'fa' to calendar and styling show correctly.

for best experience I suggest to follow along the Linux Babe tutorial on how to install LAMP and nextcloud in the flowing links:

https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/install-nextcloud-ubuntu-20-04-apache-lamp-stack

https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/install-lamp-stack-ubuntu-20-04-server-desktop

but instead of downloading the nextcloud project from the nextcloud server, use the files in this project, 
in addition there will be a builded and ready version of calendar 2.0.3 of nextcloud in the repository of it's own. (which is Fully PERSIAN and Shamsi (date picker is shamsi as well))
